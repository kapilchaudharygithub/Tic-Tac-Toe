# TIC TAC TOE Project

Welcome to the TIC TAC TOE project! This simple web-based game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. If the grid is filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
